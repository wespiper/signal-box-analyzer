# Vendor Directory

This directory contains vendored dependencies that are private or not available on PyPI.

## signal-box

The signal-box package is vendored here temporarily until it can be:
1. Made public on GitHub
2. Published to PyPI
3. Or we implement proper private repo authentication in the build process

To update the vendored package:
1. Clone the signal-box repo locally
2. Copy the signal_box package directory here
3. Commit the changes
